  title: Improper Authorisation
  description: |-
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:jira][1] is a Jenkins plugin that has an
    optional feature to update JIRA issues with a back pointer to Jenkins
    build pages. This allows the submitter and watchers to quickly find out
    which build they need to pick up to get the fix.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authorisation. The code allows attackers with Overall/Read access to
    have Jenkins connect to an attacker-specified URL using
    attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
    capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.The fixes add additional checks
    to make sure that the appropriate level of authorisation is required to
    perform administrator level tasks.

    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:jira][1] is a Jenkins plugin that has an
    optional feature to update JIRA issues with a back pointer to Jenkins
    build pages. This allows the submitter and watchers to quickly find out
    which build they need to pick up to get the fix.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. It does not declare the correct (folder) scope for per-folder
    Jira site definitions, allowing users to select and use credentials with
    System scope.
