    protection, and conduct XSS attacks via an HTTP request with both a "Transfer-Encoding:

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`tomcat:tomcat-coyote`][1] Apache Tomcat 5.5.0 through 5.5.29, 6.0.0
    through 6.0.27, and 7.0.0 beta does not properly handle an invalid
    Transfer-Encoding header, which allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (application outage) or obtain sensitive information
    via a crafted header that interferes with \"recycling of a buffer.\"



    [1]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22tomcat-coyote%22
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

    [`tomcat:tomcat-coyote`][1] Certain AJP protocol connector
    implementations in Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 through 7.0.20, 6.0.0 through
    6.0.33, 5.5.0 through 5.5.33, and possibly other versions allow remote
    attackers to spoof AJP requests, bypass authentication, and obtain
    sensitive information by causing the connector to interpret a request
    body as a new request.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [tomcat:tomcat-coyote][1] is a discontinued coyote plugin for Tomcat.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. Apache Tomcat before 6.0.39, 7.x before 7.0.47, and 8.x before
    8.0.0-RC3, when an HTTP connector or AJP connector is used, does not
    properly handle certain inconsistent HTTP request headers, which allows
    remote attackers to trigger incorrect identification of a request\'s
    length and conduct request-smuggling attacks via (1) multiple
    Content-Length headers or (2) a Content-Length header and a
    \"Transfer-Encoding: chunked\" header.

    **NOTE:** this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for
    CVE-2005-2090.
