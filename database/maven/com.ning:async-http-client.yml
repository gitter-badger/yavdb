  title: "[CVE-2013-7397]  Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity"
  description: Async Http Client (aka AHC or async-http-client) before 1.9.0 skips
    X.509 certificate verification unless both a keyStore location and a trustStore
    location are explicitly set, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof
    HTTPS servers by presenting an arbitrary certificate during use of a typical AHC
    configuration, as demonstrated by a configuration that does not send client certificates.
