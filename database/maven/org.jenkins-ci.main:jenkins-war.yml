  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.main:jenkins-war][1] is a Jenkins war file package which
    also includes additional static web resources, such as images, CSS,
    JavaScript, and some HTML files.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS). Autocompletion suggestions for text fields were not escaped,
    resulting in a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability if the
    source for the suggestions allowed specifying text that includes HTML
    metacharacters like less-than and greater-than characters.
