  title: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [io.hawt:hawtio-karaf-terminal][1] is a HTML5 web console with some
    plugins for managing Java stuff

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site request
    forgery (CSRF). An attacker could hijack the authentication of arbitrary
    users for requests that run commands on the Karaf server, as
    demonstrated by running `shutdown -f`.

  title: Improper Authentication
  description: |
    [io.hawt:hawtio-karaf-terminal][1] is a HTML5 web console with some
    plugins for managing Java stuff

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authentication. The admin terminal in did not require authentication, an
    attacker could execute arbitrary commands via the `k` parameter.
