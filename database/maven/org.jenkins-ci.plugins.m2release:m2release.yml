    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins.m2release:m2release][1] is a plugin for
    performing a maven release builds from within Jenkins.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). The `M2ReleaseAction#doSubmit` method allowed attackers
    to perform releases with attacker-specified options.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS) due to an attacker being able to inject arbitrary HTML and
    JavaScript in the plugin-provided web pages in Jenkins.

    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins.m2release:m2release][1] is a plugin for

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure
    due to credentials being stored unencrypted on the Jenkins master where
    they can be viewed by users with access to the master file system.

  title: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
  description: |+
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins.m2release:m2release][1] is a plugin for
    performing a maven release builds from within Jenkins.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML External Entity
    (XXE) Injection. While Jenkins users without Overall/Administer
    permission are not allowed to configure a custom Nexus URL, this could
    still be exploited via man-in-the-middle attacks, especially if itâ€™s not
    an HTTPS URL. Additionally, a connection test form validation method
    does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request
    forgery vulnerability. Combined, these two vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to have Jenkins parse crafted XML documents that use external
    entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side
    request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.



    [1]: https://github.com/jenkinsci/m2release-plugin/
    \nXXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML
    input. XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding
    documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
    By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external
    entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing.
    When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and
    include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.

    Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive
    data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or
    relative paths in the system identifier.

    For example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element-
    username.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
           <username>John</username>
        </xml>
    {: .language-xml}

    An external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and
    present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or
    remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML
    entity that would fetch the content of `/etc/passwd` and display it to
    the user rendered by `username`.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
        <!DOCTYPE foo [
           <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
           <username>&xxe;</username>
        </xml>
    {: .language-xml}

    Other XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop
    returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading
    to Denial of Service.
