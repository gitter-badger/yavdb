  title: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:kmap-jenkins][1] is a Jenkins plugin for
    publishing mobile applications to your Keivox KMAP Private Mobile App
    Store.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. The plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job
    config.xml files on the Jenkins master where they can be viewed by users
    with Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.

  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:kmap-jenkins][1] is a Jenkins plugin for
    publishing mobile applications to your Keivox KMAP Private Mobile App
    Store.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). A missing permission check in a form validation method
    allows users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test
    to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified credentials. The
    form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a
    CSRF vulnerability.
