  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:elliptic][1] is a Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a
    plain javascript implementation.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attack.
    Practical recovery of the long-term private key generated by the library
    is possible under certain conditions. Leakage of bit-length of a scalar
    during scalar multiplication is possible on an elliptic curve which
    might allow practical recovery of the long-term private key.
