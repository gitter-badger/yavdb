  title: "[CVE-2010-2057]  Cryptographic Issues"
  description: shared/util/StateUtils.java in Apache MyFaces 1.1.x before 1.1.8, 1.2.x
    before 1.2.9, and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 uses an encrypted View State without a Message
    Authentication Code (MAC), which makes it easier for remote attackers to perform
    successful modifications of the View State via a padding oracle attack.
