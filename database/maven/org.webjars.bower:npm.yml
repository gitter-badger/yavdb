  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [org.webjars.bower:npm][1] is a package manager for JavaScript.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. It might allow local users to bypass intended filesystem access
    restrictions due to ownerships of `/etc` and `/usr` directories are
    being changed unexpectedly, related to a \"correctMkdir\" issue.

  title: Arbitrary File Overwrite
  description: |
    [org.webjars.bower:npm][1] is a package manager for JavaScript.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Overwrite. It fails to prevent existing globally-installed binaries to
    be overwritten by other package installations. For example, if a package
    was installed globally and created a `serve` binary, any subsequent
    installs of packages that also create a `serve` binary would overwrite
    the first binary. This only affects files in `/usr/local/bin`.

    For `npm`, this behaviour is still allowed in local installations and
    also through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using
    the `--ignore-scripts` install option.

  title: Unauthorized File Access
  description: |
    [org.webjars.bower:npm][1] is a package manager for JavaScript.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Unauthorized File
    Access. It is possible for packages to create symlinks to files outside
    of the`node_modules` folder through the `bin` field upon installation.

    For `npm`, a properly constructed entry in the `package.json` bin field
    would allow a package publisher to create a symlink pointing to
    arbitrary files on a user’s system when the package is installed. This
    behaviour is possible through install scripts. This vulnerability
    bypasses a user using the `--ignore-scripts` install option.

  title: Arbitrary File Write
  description: |
    [org.webjars.bower:npm][1] is a package manager for JavaScript.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Write. It fails to prevent access to folders outside of the intended
    `node_modules` folder through the bin field.

    For `npm`, a properly constructed entry in the `package.json` bin field
    would allow a package publisher to modify and/or gain access to
    arbitrary files on a user’s system when the package is installed. This
    behaviour is possible through install scripts. This vulnerability
    bypasses a user using the `--ignore-scripts install` option.
