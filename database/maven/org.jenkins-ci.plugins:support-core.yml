  title: Arbitrary File Read
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:support-core][1] is a plugin that provides the
    basic infrastructure for generating \"bundles\" of support information
    within Jenkins.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read.
    It did not validate the paths submitted for the \"Delete Support
    Bundles\" feature. This allowed users to delete arbitrary files on the
    Jenkins master file system accessible to the OS user account running
    Jenkins. Additionally, this endpoint did not perform a permission check,
    allowing users with Overall/Read permission to delete support bundles,
    and any arbitrary other file, with a known name/path.
