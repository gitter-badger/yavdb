  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [org.igniterealtime.smack:smack-core][1] is a modular and portable open
    source XMPP client library written in Java for Android and Java (SE)
    VMs.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM) The `ServerTrustManager` component does not verify
    basicConstraints and nameConstraints in X.509 certificate chains from
    SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers
    and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate chain.
