  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [org.apache.directory.studio:org.apache.directory.studio.ldapbrowser.core][1]
    is a directory tooling platform intended to be used with an LDAP server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The CSV export function does not properly escape field values, which
    might allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands by leveraging a
    crafted LDAP entry that is interpreted as a formula when imported into a
    spreadsheet.
