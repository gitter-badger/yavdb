  title: Inadequate Encryption Strength
  description: |
    [org.opencastproject:opencast-common-jpa-impl][1] is a free and open
    source solution for automated video capture and distribution at scale.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Inadequate
    Encryption Strength. User passwords are stored in the database using the
    rather outdated and cryptographically insecure MD5 hash algorithm.
    Furthermore, the hashes are salted using the username instead of a
    random salt, causing hashes for users with the same username and
    password to collide which is problematic especially for popular users
    like the default `admin` user. This essentially means that for an
    attacker, it might be feasible to reconstruct a user\'s password given
    access to these hashes. Note that attackers needing access to the hashes
    means that they must gain access to the database in which these are
    stored first to be able to start cracking the passwords.
