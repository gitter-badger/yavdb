  title: Resource Injection
  description: |
    [org.opencastproject:base][1] is a free and open source solution for
    automated video capture and distribution at scale.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Resource Injection.
    Opencast allows almost arbitrary identifiers for media packages and
    elements to be used. This can be problematic for operation and security
    since such identifiers are sometimes used for file system operations
    which may lead to an attacker being able to escape working directories
    and write files to other locations.

    In addition, Opencast\'s `Id.toString()` vs `Id.compact()` behavior, the
    latter trying to mitigate some of the file system problems, can cause
    errors due to identifier mismatch since an identifier may
    unintentionally change.
