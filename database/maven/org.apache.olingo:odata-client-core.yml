  title: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: |
    [org.apache.olingo:odata-client-core][1] is a Java library and
    extensions around the OData specification.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-Side Request
    Forgery (SSRF). It provides the `AsyncRequestWrapperImpl` class which
    reads a URL from the Location header, and then sends a GET or DELETE
    request to this URL. It may allow to implement a SSRF attack. If an
    attacker tricks a client to connect to a malicious server, the server
    can make the client call any URL including internal resources which are
    not directly accessible by the attacker.
