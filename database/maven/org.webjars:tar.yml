  title: Arbitrary File Overwrite
  description: |
    [org.webjars:tar][1] is a full-featured Tar for Node.js.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Overwrite. Extracting tarballs containing a hard-link to a file that
    already exists in the system, and a file that matches the hard-link may
    overwrite system\'s files with the contents of the extracted file.

  title: Symlink File Overwrite
  description: |
    [org.webjars:tar][1] is a full-featured Tar for Node.js.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Symlink File
    Overwrite. It does not properly normalize symbolic links pointing to
    targets outside the extraction root. As a result, packages may hold
    symbolic links to parent and sibling directories and overwrite those
    files when the package is extracted.
