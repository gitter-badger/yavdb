  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:websphere-deployer][1] is a deployment plugin
    for WebSphere on Jenkins

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml`
    files on the Jenkins master where they can be viewed by users with
    Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.

    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:websphere-deployer][1] is a deployment plugin
    for WebSphere on Jenkins

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM). The plugin allows users with Overall/Read access to disable
    SSL/TLS certificate and hostname validation for the entire Jenkins
    master JVM.

  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:websphere-deployer][1] is a deployment plugin
    for WebSphere on Jenkins

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). The plugin does not perform permission checks in methods
    performing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access
    to perform connection tests, determine whether files with an
    attacker-specified path exist on the Jenkins master file system, and
    obtain limited information about the Jenkins and plugin configuration
    based on the responses. The latter include the ability to set plugin
    configuration options.

    Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST
    requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
