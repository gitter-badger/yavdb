  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:sounds][1] is a plugin that allows Jenkins to
    play arbitrary audio clips as build actions and notifications.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). It does not perform permission checks in URLs performing
    form validation. This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to
    execute arbitrary OS commands as the OS user account running Jenkins.
    Additionally, these form validation URLs do not require POST requests,
    resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
