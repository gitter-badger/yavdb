    [`org.jboss.native:mod-cluster`][1] mod\_cluster 1.0.10 before 1.0.10
    CP03 and 1.1.x before 1.1.4, as used in JBoss Enterprise Application
    Platform 5.1.2, when \"ROOT\" is set to excludedContexts, exposes the
    root context of the server, which allows remote attackers to bypass
    access restrictions and gain access to applications deployed on the root
    context via unspecified vectors.

  title: mod_cluster registers and exposes the root context of a server by default,
    despite ROOT being in the excluded-contexts list
  description: 'mod_cluster 1.0.10 CP02 and 1.1.3 registers and exposes the root context
    of  a server by default, despite ROOT being in the excludedContexts list. This  is
    due to a regression that bypassed context filtering for the root context,  causing
    the root context to be enabled inadvertently. This flaw is fixed in  mod_cluster
    1.0.10 CP03 and 1.1.4.
