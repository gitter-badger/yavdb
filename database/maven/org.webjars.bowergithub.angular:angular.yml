  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: |
    [org.webjars.bowergithub.angular:angular][1] is a package that lets you
    write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser. It
    also lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend
    HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly and
    succinctly.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.
    The function `merge()` could be tricked into adding or modifying
    properties of `Object.prototype` using a `__proto__` payload.
