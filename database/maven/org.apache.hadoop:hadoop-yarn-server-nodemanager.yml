  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |
    [`org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager`][1] is a framework
    that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across
    clusters of computers using simple programming models.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command
    Execution.

    In Apache Hadoop 2.8.0, 3.0.0-alpha1, and 3.0.0-alpha2, the
    LinuxContainerExecutor runs docker commands as root with insufficient
    input validation. When the docker feature is enabled, authenticated
    users can run commands as root.

  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |
    [org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager][1] is a resource
    management and job scheduling technology in the open source Hadoop
    distributed processing framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command
    Execution. A user who could escalate to yarn user could possibly run
    arbitrary commands as root user.

    **Note** This vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix for the
    `CVE-2016-6811`.
