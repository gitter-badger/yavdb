  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [org.apache.sentry:sentry-binding-hive][1] is a highly modular system
    for providing fine grained role based authorization to both data and
    metadata stored on an Apache Hadoop cluster.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. An authenticated user could execute `ALTER TABLE EXCHANGE
    PARTITIONS`. They could access to the partitioned data of a Sentry
    protected table and remove data from a Sentry protected table.

    for providing fine grained role based authorization to both data and
    metadata stored on an Apache Hadoop cluster.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. Multiple incomplete blacklist vulnerabilities allow remote
    authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via the (1) `reflect`, (2)
    `reflect2`, or (3) `java_method` Hive builtin functions. Exploitation of
    these methods require authentication.
