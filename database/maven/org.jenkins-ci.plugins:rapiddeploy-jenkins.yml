  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:rapiddeploy-jenkins][1] is a plugin that
    provides the best way of using all the functionality and benefits of
    RapidDeploy from a Jenkins job or pipeline.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). The plugin does not perform a permission check on form
    validation methods. This allows users with Overall/Read access to
    Jenkins to connect to RapidDeploy-related paths on an attacker-specified
    web server.

    Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST
    requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
