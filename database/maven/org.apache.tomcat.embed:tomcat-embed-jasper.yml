    Apache Tomcat before 6.0.39, 7.x before 7.0.50, and 8.x before
    8.0.0-RC10 allows attackers to obtain \"Tomcat internals\" information
    by leveraging the presence of an untrusted web application with a
    context.xml, web.xml, \*.jspx, \*.tagx, or \*.tld XML document
    containing an external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity
    reference, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.

  title: Arbitrary File Read
  description: |
    [`org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-jasper`][1] Apache Tomcat before
    6.0.40, 7.x before 7.0.54, and 8.x before 8.0.6 does not properly
    constrain the class loader that accesses the XML parser used with an
    XSLT stylesheet, which allows remote attackers to (1) read arbitrary
    files via a crafted web application that provides an XML external entity
    declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML
    External Entity (XXE) issue, or (2) read files associated with different
    web applications on a single Tomcat instance via a crafted web
    application.

  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [`org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-jasper`][1] The Expression
    Language (EL) implementation in Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.44, 7.x
    before 7.0.58, and 8.x before 8.0.16 does not properly consider the
    possibility of an accessible interface implemented by an inaccessible
    class, which allows attackers to bypass a SecurityManager protection
    mechanism via a web application that leverages use of incorrect
    privileges during EL evaluation.
