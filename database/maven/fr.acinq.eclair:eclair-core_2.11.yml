  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [fr.acinq.eclair:eclair-core\_2.11][1] is a scala implementation of the
    Lightning Network.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. A lightning node accepting a channel must check that the
    funding transaction output does indeed open the channel proposed.
    Otherwise an attacker can claim to open a channel but either not pay to
    the peer, or not pay the full amount. Once that transaction reaches the
    minimum depth, it can spend funds from the channel. The victim will only
    notice when it tries to close the channel and none of the commitment or
    mutual close transactions it has are valid.

    *NOTE:* README.md states \"it is beta-quality software and don\'t put
    too much money in it.\"
