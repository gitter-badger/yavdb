  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:mqtt-packet][1] is an Encoder and Decoder for MQTT.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Buffer Over-read. An
    attacker could trigger an out of range read on a buffer which throws a
    `RangeError`. `MQTT` Brokers using this module could be forced to crash
    by sending a specifically malformed `MQTT` Subscribe packet.
