  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.apache.nifi:nifi-framework-bundle][1] is a system to process and
    distribute data.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. When updating a Process Group via the API, the response to the
    request includes all of its contents (at the top most level, not
    recursively). The response included details about processors and
    controller services which the user may not have had read access to.

    [org.apache.nifi:nifi-framework-bundle][1] is a system to process and
    distribute data.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The flow fingerprint factory generated flow fingerprints which
    included sensitive property descriptor values. In the event a node
    attempted to join a cluster and the cluster flow was not inheritable,
    the flow fingerprint of both the cluster and local flow was printed,
    potentially containing sensitive values in plaintext.
