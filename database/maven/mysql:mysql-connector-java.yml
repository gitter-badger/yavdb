    [mysql:mysql-connector-java][1] provides connectivity for client
    applications developed in the Java programming language with MySQL
    Connector/J, a driver that implements the Java Database Connectivity
    (JDBC) API.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. A user with high privileges who is logged onto the
    infrastructure where MySQL Connectors executes to compromise MySQL
    Connectors. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person
    other than the attacker.
