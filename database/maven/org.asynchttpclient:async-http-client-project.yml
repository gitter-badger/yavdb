  title: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: |
    [org.asynchttpclient:async-http-client-project][1] is a package that
    allows Java applications to easily execute HTTP requests and
    asynchronously process the response.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server Side Request
    Forgery (SSRF). Async Http Client (aka async-http-client) before 2.0.35
    can be tricked into connecting to a host different from the one
    extracted by java.net.URI if a \'?\' character occurs in a fragment
    identifier. Similar bugs were previously identified in cURL
    (CVE-2016-8624) and Oracle Java 8 java.net.URL.
