  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:rundeck][1] is a Notifier that will talk to a
    RunDeck instance (via its HTTP API) to schedule a job execution on
    RunDeck after a successful build on Jenkins.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). It does not perform permission checks on a method
    implementing form validation. This allows users with `Overall/Read`
    access to Jenkins to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified
    server with attacker-specified username and password. In addition, the
    form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a
    CSRF vulnerability.

  title: Credential Exposure
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:rundeck][1] is a Notifier that will talk to a
    RunDeck instance (via its HTTP API) to schedule a job execution on
    RunDeck after a successful build on Jenkins.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Credential Exposure.
    Credentials are stored unencrypted in its global configuration file and
    in job config.xml files on the Jenkins master where they can be viewed
    by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the master file
    system.
