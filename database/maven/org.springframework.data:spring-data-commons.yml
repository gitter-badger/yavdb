  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [org.springframework.data:spring-data-commons][1] is part of the
    umbrella Spring Data project that provides shared infrastructure across
    the Spring Data projects.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. An unauthenticated remote malicious user (or attacker) can
    supply specially crafted request parameters against Spring Data REST
    backed HTTP resources or using Spring Data\'s projection-based request
    payload binding hat can lead to a remote code execution attack.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [org.springframework.data:spring-data-commons][1] is a part of the
    umbrella Spring Data project that provides shared infrastructure across
    the Spring Data projects. It contains technology neutral repository
    interfaces as well as a metadata model for persisting Java classes.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS) attacks. It contains a property path parser vulnerability caused
    by unlimited resource allocation. An unauthenticated remote malicious
    user (or attacker) can issue requests against Spring Data REST endpoints
    or endpoints using property path parsing which can cause a denial of
    service (CPU and memory consumption).



    [1]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
