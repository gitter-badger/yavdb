  title: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:nodegit][1] is a Node bindings to the libgit2 project.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Link
    Resolution Before File Access. Filenames on Linux/Unix can contain
    backslashes. On Windows, backslashes are directory separators. Git did
    not use to refuse to write out tracked files with such filenames.

    The exploit uses backslashes in the file names stored in tree objects,
    allowing arbitrary files even outside of the Git worktree to be
    over-written.

    **Note:** This is a Windows-only vulnerability.

  title: Improper Handling of Alternate Data Stream
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:nodegit][1] is a Node bindings to the libgit2 project.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Handling of
    Alternate Data Stream. When running Git in the Windows Subsystem for
    Linux (also known as \"WSL\") while accessing a working directory on a
    regular Windows drive, none of the NTFS protections were active.

    This vulnerability affects Git when running inside the [Windows
    Subsystem for Linux][2] and only when working on Windows drives where
    NTFS short names are enabled (which is the case, by default, for the
    system drive, i.e. `C:`).

    The exploit uses a directory named `git~1` and it allows remote code
    execution during a regular `git clone`.

    For this reason, Git now turns on `core.protectNTFS` by default, which
    is also required to address CVE-2019-1352.

  title: Directory Traversal
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:nodegit][1] is a Node bindings to the libgit2 project.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal.
    While the only permitted drive letters for physical drives on Windows
    are letters of the US-English alphabet, this restriction does not apply
    to virtual drives assigned via `subst <letter>: <path>`. Git mistook
    such paths for relative paths, allowing writing outside of the worktree
    while cloning.

    This vulnerability can only be exploited on Windows, and only when the
    targeted user is known to use non-alphabetical drive letters on logical
    drives registered with the `subst.exe` command, allowing to overwrite
    arbitrary files on said logical drive during a regular `git clone`.

  title: Improper Handling of Alternate Data Stream
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:nodegit][1] is a Node bindings to the libgit2 project.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Handling of
    Alternate Data Stream. Git was unaware of NTFS Alternate Data Streams,
    allowing files inside the `.git/` directory to be overwritten during a
    clone.

    While the description contains \"NTFS\", this vulnerability can not only
    be exploited on Windows, but also on macOS when working on
    `smb://`-mounted network shares. The exploit involves naming a directory
    `.git::$INDEX_ALLOCATION`, allowing remote code execution during a
    regular `git clone`.

    The fix for this CVE requires the fix for CVE-2019-1353.
