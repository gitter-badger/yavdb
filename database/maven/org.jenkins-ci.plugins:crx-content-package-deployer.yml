  title: User Enummeration
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:crx-content-package-deployer][1] is a Jenkins
    plugin that Deploys content packages to Adobe CRX applications, like
    Adobe CQ/AEM.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to User Enummeration. A
    missing permission check in Jenkins CRX Content Package Deployer in
    various `doFillCredentialsIdItems` methods allowed users with
    Overall/Read access to enumerate credentials ID of credentials stored in
    Jenkins.

  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:crx-content-package-deployer][1] is a Jenkins
    plugin that Deploys content packages to Adobe CRX applications, like
    Adobe CQ/AEM.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). It did not perform permission checks on a method
    implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read
    access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using
    attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
    capturing credentials stored in Jenkins. In addition, the form
    validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF
    vulnerability.
