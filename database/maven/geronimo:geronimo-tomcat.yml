  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [geronimo:geronimo-tomcat][1] is a server runtime that integrates the
    best open source projects to create Java/OSGi server runtimes that meet
    the needs of enterprise developers and system administrators.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). It computes hash values for form parameters without restricting
    the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many
    crafted parameters.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
