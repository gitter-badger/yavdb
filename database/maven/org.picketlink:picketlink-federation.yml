  title: "[CVE-2014-7827]  Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls"
  description: The org.jboss.security.plugins.mapping.JBossMappingManager implementation
    in JBoss Security in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) before
    6.3.3 uses the default security domain when a security domain is undefined, which
    allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging
    credentials on the default domain for a role that is also on the application domain.
