  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [org.jasypt:jasypt][1] is a java library which allows the developer to
    add basic encryption capabilities to his/her projects with minimum
    effort, and without the need of having deep knowledge on how
    cryptography works.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attacks via
    the `Arrays.equals` function. A local user can conduct a timing attack
    on password hash comparison in the Jasypt component to determine
    passwords on the target system.
