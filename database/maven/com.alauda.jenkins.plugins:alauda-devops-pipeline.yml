  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [com.alauda.jenkins.plugins:alauda-devops-pipeline][1] is a plugin for
    Jenkins

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). The plugin does not perform permission checks on a
    method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read
    access to Jenkins to connect to Kubernetes-related paths on an
    attacker-specified web server using attacker-specified credentials IDs
    obtained through another method, capturing token credentials managed by
    Alauda DevOps Pipeline Plugin.

    Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
    resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
