  title: Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip)
  description: "[org.webjars.npm:decompress-zip][1] extracts the contents of the ZIP\narchive
    file.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write\nvia
    Archive Extraction (Zip Slip). The package will extract files\noutside of the
    scope of the specified target directory because there is\nno validation that file
    extraction stays within the defined target path.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/decompress-zip\n\\nIt
    is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path\ntraversal
    filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive\nis concatenated
    to the target extraction directory, which results in the\nfinal path ending up
    outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip\nmay hold a file with a \\\"../../file.exe\\\"
    location and thus break out of\nthe target folder. If an executable or a configuration
    file is\noverwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn\ninto
    an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example
    of a zip archive with one benign file and\none malicious file. Extracting the
    malicous file will result in\ntraversing out of the target folder, ending up in
    `/root/.ssh/`\noverwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n    \n    +2018-04-15
