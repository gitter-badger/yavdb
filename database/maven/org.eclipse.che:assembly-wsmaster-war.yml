  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.eclipse.che:assembly-wsmaster-war][1] is a next-generation
    container development platform, developer workspace server and cloud IDE

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). With both authentication and TLS disabled, visiting a
    malicious web site could trigger the start of an arbitrary Che
    workspace. Che with no authentication and no TLS is not usually deployed
    on a public network but is often used for local installations (e.g. on
    personal laptops). In this case, even if the Che API is not exposed
    externally, some javascript running in the local browser is able to send
    requests to it.
