  title: RandomBytes is not random enough

    This is not generating sufficiently random bytes. Math.random was never intended for use in cryptographic applications.

  title: Insecure Randomness
  description: |
    [org.webjars.bower:crypto-js][1] is a library of crypto standards.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness.
    The `secureRandom()` method is supposed to return a cryptographically
    strong pseudo-random data string, but it is biased to certain digits. An
    attacker could be able to guess the created digits.
