  title: Arbitrary Shell Execution
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ec2][1] allows Jenkins to start slaves on EC2 or
    Eucalyptus on demand, and kill them as they get unused.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Shell
    Execution. It could configure an EC2 agent to run arbitrary shell
    commands on the master node whenever the agent was supposed to be
    launched. Configuration of these agents now requires the `Run Scripts`
    permission typically only granted to administrators.

  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ec2][1] is a plugin for controlling agents on
    EC2 or Eucalyptus.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). It does not perform permission checks in methods
    performing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access
    to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL within the AWS region
    using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another
    method. Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST
    requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
