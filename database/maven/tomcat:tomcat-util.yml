  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`tomcat:tomcat-util`][1] Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.35, 6.x before
    6.0.34, and 7.x before 7.0.23 uses an inefficient approach for handling
    parameters, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (CPU consumption) via a request that contains many parameters and
    parameter values, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4858.



    [1]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22tomcat-util%22
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
  description: |+
    [`tomcat:tomcat-util`][1] Affected versions of the package are
    vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection. Apache Tomcat before
    6.0.39, 7.x before 7.0.50, and 8.x before 8.0.0-RC10 allows attackers to
    obtain \"Tomcat internals\" information by leveraging the presence of an
    untrusted web application with a context.xml, web.xml, \*.jspx, \*.tagx,
    or \*.tld XML document containing an external entity declaration in
    conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML External Entity
    (XXE) issue.



    [1]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22tomcat-util%22
    \nXXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML
    input. XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding
    documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
    By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external
    entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing.
    When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and
    include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.

    Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive
    data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or
    relative paths in the system identifier.

    For example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element-
    username.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
           <username>John</username>
        </xml>
    {: .language-xml}

    An external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and
    present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or
    remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML
    entity that would fetch the content of `/etc/passwd` and display it to
    the user rendered by `username`.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
        <!DOCTYPE foo [
           <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
           <username>&xxe;</username>
        </xml>
    {: .language-xml}

    Other XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop
    returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading
    to Denial of Service.

    [`tomcat:tomcat-util`][1] Affected versions of the package are
    vulnerable to Information Exposure. It was discovered that when a
    SecurityManager is configured Tomcat\'s system property replacement
    feature for configuration files could be used by a malicious web
    application to bypass the SecurityManager and read system properties
    that should not be visible.
