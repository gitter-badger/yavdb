  title: Multipart Content Pollution
  description: |
    [org.springframework:spring-webflux][1] Spring provides everything you
    need beyond the Java language to create enterprise applications in a
    wide range of scenarios and architectures.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Multipart Content
    Pollution. It provides client-side support for multipart requests. When
    the server application (server A) receives input from a remote client,
    and then uses that input to make a multipart request to another server
    (server B), it can be exposed to an attack, where an extra multipart is
    inserted in the content of the request from server A, causing server B
    to use the wrong value for a part it expects. This could to lead
    privilege escalation, for example, if the part content represents a
    username or user roles.

  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.springframework:spring-webflux][1] is a Spring Framework module
    that contains support for reactive HTTP and WebSocket clients as well as
    for reactive server web applications including REST, HTML browser, and
    WebSocket style interactions.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) through CORS preflight requests that target Spring MVC
    (`spring-webmvc` module) or Spring WebFlux (`spring-webflux` module)
    endpoints. Only non-authenticated endpoints are vulnerable because
    preflight requests should not include credentials and therefore requests
    should fail authentication. However a notable exception to this are
    Chrome based browsers when using client certificates for authentication
    since Chrome sends TLS client certificates in CORS preflight requests in
    violation of spec requirements. No HTTP body can be sent or received as
    a result of this attack.

  title: Reflected File Download (RFD)
  description: |
    [org.springframework:spring-webflux][1] is a Spring Framework module
    that contains support for reactive HTTP and WebSocket clients as well as
    for reactive server web applications including REST, HTML browser, and
    WebSocket style interactions.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Reflected File
    Download (RFD). A reflected file download attack is possible when the
    filename attribute of the `Content-Disposition` header is derived from
    user-supplied input.
