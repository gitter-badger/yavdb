    [`org.apache.tomcat:jasper`][1] Apache Tomcat before 6.0.39, 7.x before
    7.0.50, and 8.x before 8.0.0-RC10 allows attackers to obtain \"Tomcat
    internals\" information by leveraging the presence of an untrusted web
    application with a context.xml, web.xml, \*.jspx, \*.tagx, or \*.tld XML
    document containing an external entity declaration in conjunction with
    an entity reference, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.

  title: Arbitrary File Read
  description: |
    [`org.apache.tomcat:jasper`][1] Apache Tomcat before 6.0.40, 7.x before
    7.0.54, and 8.x before 8.0.6 does not properly constrain the class
    loader that accesses the XML parser used with an XSLT stylesheet, which
    allows remote attackers to (1) read arbitrary files via a crafted web
    application that provides an XML external entity declaration in
    conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML External Entity
    (XXE) issue, or (2) read files associated with different web
    applications on a single Tomcat instance via a crafted web application.

  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [`org.apache.tomcat:jasper`][1] The Expression Language (EL)
    implementation in Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.44, 7.x before 7.0.58,
    and 8.x before 8.0.16 does not properly consider the possibility of an
    accessible interface implemented by an inaccessible class, which allows
    attackers to bypass a SecurityManager protection mechanism via a web
    application that leverages use of incorrect privileges during EL
    evaluation.
