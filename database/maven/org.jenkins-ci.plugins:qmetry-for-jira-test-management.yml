    Test Management for JIRA plugin for Jenkins has been designed to
    seamlessly integrate your CI/CD pipeline with QMetry.

    configuration. While the password is stored encrypted on disk since

    plain text as part of the configuration form. This can result in
    exposure of the password through browser extensions.
