  title: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:teamconcert][1] is a plugin that Jenkins with
    Rational Team Concert source control and build using the richer features
    of the build toolkit instead of the command line.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. A missing permission check in form-related
    methods allowed users with Overall/Read access to enumerate credentials
    ID of credentials stored in Jenkins.

  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:teamconcert][1] is a plugin that Jenkins with
    Rational Team Concert source control and build using the richer features
    of the build toolkit instead of the command line.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). The plugin does not perform permission checks on a
    method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read
    access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using
    attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
    capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
    resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
