  title: Missing Authorization
  description: |
    [org.opencastproject:opencast-oaipmh-api][1] is a free and open source
    solution for automated video capture and distribution at scale.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Missing
    Authorization. Impact Media publication via OAI-PMH allows
    unauthenticated public access to all media and metadata by default.
    OAI-PMH is part of the default workflow and is activated by default,
    requiring active user intervention of users to protect media. This leads
    to users unknowingly handing out public access to events without their
    knowledge.
