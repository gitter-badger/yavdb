  title: WSGI header spoofing
  description: |
    [`waitress`][1] is a Waitress WSGI server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to WSGI header
    spoofing. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by using an
    `_` character instead of a `-` in an HTTP header. In the WSGI environ,
    the `X-Auth-User` and the `X-Auth_User` headers are both converted to
    `HTTP_X_Auth_User`, allowing the attacker to bypass the protection. This
    vulnerability is related to [CVE-2015-0219][2]

  title: HTTP Response Splitting
  description: |
    [`waitress`][1] is a Waitress WSGI server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP response
    splitting attacks. It is possible to set arbitrary headers in the HTTP
    response by embedding a \\r or \\n character in the header value, and
    sending it to the server.

  title: HTTP Request Smuggling
  description: |
    [waitress][1] is a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very
    acceptable performance.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Request
    Smuggling. It would parse the `Transfer-Encoding` header and only look
    for a single string value, if that value was not chunked it would fall
    through and use the Content-Length header instead. According to the HTTP
    standard Transfer-Encoding should be a comma separated list, with the
    inner-most encoding first, followed by any further transfer codings,
    ending with chunked. Requests sent with: `Transfer-Encoding: gzip,
    chunked` would incorrectly get ignored, and the request would use a
    Content-Length header instead to determine the body size of the HTTP
    message. This could allow for Waitress to treat a single request as
    multiple requests in the case of HTTP pipelining.
