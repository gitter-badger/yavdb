  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [splunk-sdk][1] is a Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python that
    contains library code and examples designed to enable developers to
    build applications using Splunk.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM) attacks. The package does not properly verify untrusted TLS
    server certificates due to a logic flaw in the way the `verify` argument
    was used when validating an SSL connection.
