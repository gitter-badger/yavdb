  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [wagtail-2fa][1] is a Django app adding two factor authentication to
    Wagtail.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. If a malicious user gains access to someone\'s Wagtail login
    credentials, they can log into the CMS and bypass the 2FA check by
    changing the URL. They can then add a new device and gain full access to
    the CMS.
