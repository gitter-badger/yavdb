  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [`celery`][1] is a Distributed Task Queue. Celery 2.1 and 2.2 before
    2.2.8, 2.3 before 2.3.4, and 2.4 before 2.4.4 changes the effective id
    but not the real id during processing of the --uid and --gid arguments
    to celerybeat, celeryd\_detach, celeryd-multi, and celeryev, which
    allows local users to gain privileges via vectors involving crafted code
    that is executed by the worker process.

  title: Insecure Default
  description: |
    [`celery`][1] is a Distributed Task Queue. Affected versions of this
    package are vulnerable due to an Insecure Default. The `accept_content`
    setting was set to: `app.conf.accept_content = ['json', 'pickle',
    'msgpack', 'yaml']` by default, allowed deserialization of pickled
    messages, even if the software is configured to send messages in the
    JSON format.

    **Note** An attacker requires access to the message broker used to send
    messages to Celery workers in order to exploit this vulnerability.
