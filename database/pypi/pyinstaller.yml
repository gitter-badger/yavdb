  title: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges
  description: |
    [pyInstaller][1] is a package that bundles a Python application and all
    its dependencies into a single package

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Execution with
    Unnecessary Privileges. On Windows only, a local privilege escalation
    vulnerability is present in this particular case: If a software using
    PyInstaller in \"onefile\" mode is launched by a privileged user (at
    least more than the current one) which have his \"TempPath\" resolving
    to a world writable directory. This is the case for example if the
    software is launched as a service or as a scheduled task using a system
    account (TempPath will be `C:\Windows\Temp`). In order to be exploitable
    the software has to be (re)started after the attacker launch the exploit
    program, so for a service launched at startup, a service restart is
    needed (e.g. after a crash or an upgrade).
