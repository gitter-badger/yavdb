  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [keystone][1] is a that provides authentication, authorization and
    service discovery mechanisms via HTTP primarily for use by projects in
    the OpenStack family.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. The LDAP backend in OpenStack Identity (Keystone) Grizzly
    and Havana, when removing a role on a tenant for a user who does not
    have that role, adds the role to the user, which allows local users to
    gain privileges.

    service discovery mechanisms via HTTP primarily for use by projects in
    the OpenStack family.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege Escalation
    via the list credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able
    to list any credentials with the `/v3/credentials` API when
    `enforce_scope` is false.
