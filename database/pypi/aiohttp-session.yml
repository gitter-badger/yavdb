  title: Session Fixation
  description: |
    [aiohttp-session][1] provides sessions for aiohttp.web.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Session Fixation.

    The `Get session data` function returns an empty dictionary for an empty
    or invalidated session. `save_session` takes this data and saves it in
    Redis.

    As a result, an invalidated session will result to the session ID being
    present in Redis with an empty mapping as its value. If the key (session
    ID) is not present in Redis, RedisStorage\'s `load_session` function
    would only look at cases where data (returned by reading from Redis) is
    `None`. As a result the `load_session` function would return a session
    with the presented session ID and not a new one, although there was no
    valid session in storage for this ID.

    \##Remediation Upgrade `aiohttp-session` to version 2.4.0 or higher.

  title: Insufficient Session Expiration
  description: |
    [aiohttp-session][1] provides sessions for aiohttp.web.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficient Session
    Expiration via the `EncryptedCookieStorage` and `NaClCookieStorage`
    functions that can result in Non-expiring sessions / Infinite lifespan.
    This attack appear to be exploitable via Recreation of a cookie
    post-expiry with the same value.
