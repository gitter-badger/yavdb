  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`accesscontrol`][1] is a Security framework for Zope2. The sandbox
    whitelisting function (allowmodule.py) in Plone before 4.2.3 and 4.3
    before beta 1 allows remote authenticated users with certain privileges
    to bypass the Python sandbox restriction and execute arbitrary Python
    code via vectors related to importing.

  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [`accesscontrol`][1] is a Security framework for Zope2.
    AccessControl/AuthEncoding.py in Zope before 2.13.19, as used in Plone
    before 4.2.3 and 4.3 before beta 1, allows remote attackers to obtain
    passwords via vectors involving timing discrepancies in password
    validation.

  title: Insecure Randomness
  description: |
    [`accesscontrol`][1] is a Security framework for Zope2. Zope before
    2.13.19, as used in Plone before 4.2.3 and 4.3 before beta 1, does not
    reseed the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG), which makes it easier
    for remote attackers to guess the value via unspecified vectors. NOTE:
    this issue was SPLIT from CVE-2012-5508 due to different vulnerability
    types (ADT2).
