  title: HTTP Request Smuggling
  description: |
    [gunicorn][1] is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Request
    Smuggling. It fails to properly process the `Transfer-Encoding` and
    `Content-Length` headers when both are present in a package request.
    This allows for conflicting information to be sent regarding the length
    of the package, which when processed by back-end servers under certain
    configurations would allow for malicious users to bypass security
    controls, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, and directly
    compromise other application users.
