  title: Session Key Exposure
  description: |
    [django-user-sessions][1] is a Django sessions with a foreign key to the
    user.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Session Key
    Exposure. The views provided allow users to terminate specific sessions.
    The session key is used to identify sessions, and thus included in the
    rendered HTML. In itself this is not a problem. However if the website
    has an XSS vulnerability, the session key could be extracted by the
    attacker and a session takeover could happen.
