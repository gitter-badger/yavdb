  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [phppgadmin/phppgadmin][1] is a web-based administration tool for
    PostgreSQL. It is perfect for PostgreSQL DBAs, newbies, and hosting
    services.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). Multiple areas within the application allows sensitive
    actions to be performed without validating that the request originated
    from the application. One such area, `database.php` â€‹ does not verify
    the source of an HTTP request. This can be leveraged by a remote
    attacker to trick a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious page
    with a CSRF exploit and execute arbitrary system commands on the server.
