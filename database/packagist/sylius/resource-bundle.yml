  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [sylius/resource-bundle][1] is a resource component for Sylius.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. `ResourceBundle` accepts and uses any serialisation groups to
    be passed via a HTTP header. This might lead to data exposure by using
    an unintended serialisation group - for example it could make Shop API
    use a more permissive group from Admin API.
