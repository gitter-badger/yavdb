  description: |
    [scheb/two-factor-bundle][1] is a package that Provides two-factor
    authentication for Symfony applications.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. The firewall\'s `security.authentication.rememberme.*` services
    didn\'t prevent the remember-me cookie from being set when the user
    enters a two-factor process after a successful login.
