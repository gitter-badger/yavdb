  title: Arbitrary Code Injection
  description: |
    [listening-processes][1] is a simple NPM module for retrieving pertinent
    info on processes which are listening on local ports, and for killing
    those processes using shell commands in the background.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Injection. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands by escaping the
    binaries used by the module since it uses bash commands.
