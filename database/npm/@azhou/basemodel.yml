  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    [@azhou/basemodel][1] is a package.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection. All
    table names and fields arguments of all methods are fed directly into
    query by string concatenation without escaping which may lead to sql
    injection. In addition, `order by` fields of `model.getAll(fields,
    orderby)` is not escaped and directly used in query which lead to blind
    sql injection.
