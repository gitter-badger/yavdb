  description: |
    [slp-validate][1] is a Lightweight SLP validator with pre-broadcast
    validation and burn protection.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Inadequate
    Encryption Strength. A specially crafted Bitcoin script can cause a
    discrepancy between the specified SLP consensus rules and the validation
    result. An attacker can create a specially crafted Bitcoin script in
    order to cause a hard-fork from the SLP consensus.
