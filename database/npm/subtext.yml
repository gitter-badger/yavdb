    The package fails to enforce the `maxBytes` configuration for payloads with chunked
    encoding that are written to the file system. This allows attackers to send requests
    with arbitrary payload sizes, which may exhaust system resources leading to Denial
    of Service.

  title: Denial of Service
  description: Versions of `subtext` >=4.1.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service.
    The Content-Encoding HTTP header parser has a vulnerability which will cause the
    function to throw a system error if the header contains some invalid values. Because
    hapi rethrows system errors (as opposed to catching expected application errors),
    the error is thrown all the way up the stack. If no unhandled exception handler
    is available, the application will exist, allowing an attacker to shut down services.

  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: All versions of `subtext` are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. A
    multipart payload can be constructed in a way that one of the parts’ content can
    be set as the entire payload object’s prototype. If this prototype contains data,
    it may bypass other validation rules which enforce access and privacy. If this
    prototype evaluates to null, it can cause unhandled exceptions when the request
    payload is accessed.

    [subtext][1] is a HTTP payload parsing library. Deprecated.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). The package fails to enforce the `maxBytes` configuration for
    payloads with chunked encoding that are written to the file system. This
    allows attackers to send requests with arbitrary payload sizes, which
    may exhaust system resources.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
