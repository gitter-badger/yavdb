  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |
    [smartbanner.js][1] is a customisable smart app banner for iOS and
    Android.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS). Clicking on smartbanner *View* link and navigating to 3rd party
    page leaves `window.opener` exposed. It may allow hostile 3rd parties to
    abuse `window.opener`, e.g. by redirection or injection on the original
    page with smartbanner.
