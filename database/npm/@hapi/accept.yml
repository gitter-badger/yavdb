  title: Denial of Service
  description: Versions of `@hapi/accept` prior to 3.2.4 or 5.0.1 are vulnerable to
    Denial of Service. The Accept-Encoding HTTP header parser has a vulnerability
    which will cause the function to throw a system error if the header contains some
    invalid values. Because hapi rethrows system errors (as opposed to catching expected
    application errors), the error is thrown all the way up the stack. If no unhandled
    exception handler is available, the application will exist, allowing an attacker
    to shut down services.
  affected_package: "@hapi/accept"
  vulnerable_versions:
  - ">=3.2.0 <3.2.4"
  - ">=4.0.0 <5.0.1"
