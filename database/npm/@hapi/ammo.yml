  title: Denial of Service
  description: Versions of `@hapi/ammo` prior to 3.1.2 or 5.0.1 are vulnerable to
    Denial of Service. The Range HTTP header parser has a vulnerability which will
    cause the function to throw a system error if the header is set to an invalid
    value. Because hapi is not expecting the function to ever throw, the error is
    thrown all the way up the stack. If no unhandled exception handler is available,
    the application will exist, allowing an attacker to shut down services.
  affected_package: "@hapi/ammo"
  vulnerable_versions:
  - "<3.1.2"
  - ">=4.0.0 <5.0.1"
  severity: high
  package_manager: npm
