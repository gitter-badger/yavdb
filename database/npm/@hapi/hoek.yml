  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: "Versions of `@hapi/hoek` prior to 8.5.1 and 9.0.3 are vulnerable to
    Prototype Pollution. The `clone` function fails to prevent the modification of
    the Object prototype when passed specially-crafted input. Attackers may use this
    to change existing properties that exist in all objects, which may lead to Denial
    of Service or Remote Code Execution in specific circumstances.  \nThis issue __does
    not__ affect hapi applications since the framework protects against such malicious
    inputs. Applications that use `@hapi/hoek` outside of the hapi ecosystem may be
    vulnerable."
