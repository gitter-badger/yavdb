  title: Cross-Site Scripting
  description: Versions of `nextcloud-vue-collections` prior to 0.4.2 are vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).  The `v-tooltip` component has an insecure `defaultHTML`
    configuration that allows arbitrary JavaScript to be injected in the tooltip of
    a collection item. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in a victim's
    browser.
