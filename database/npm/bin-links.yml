  title: Arbitrary File Write
  description: Versions of `bin-links` prior to 1.1.5 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary
    File Write. The package fails to restrict access to folders outside of the intended
    `node_modules` folder through the `bin` field. This allows attackers to create
    arbitrary files in the system.

    folder through the `bin` field. This may allow attackers to access unauthorized
    files.

  title: Arbitrary File Overwrite
  description: Versions of  `bin-links` prior to 1.1.6 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary
    File Overwrite. It fails to prevent globally-installed binaries to be overwritten
    by other package installs. For example, if a package was installed globally and
    created a `serve` binary, any subsequent installs of packages that also create
    a `serve` binary would overwrite the first binary. This behavior is still allowed
    in local installations.
