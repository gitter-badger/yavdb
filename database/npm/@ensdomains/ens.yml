  title: Improper Authorization
  description: |
    [@ensdomains/ens][1] is an implementation for registrars and local
    resolvers for the Ethereum Name Service.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authorization. A user who owns an ENS domain can set a \"trapdoor\",
    allowing them to transfer ownership to another user, and later regain
    ownership without the new owner\'s consent or awareness
