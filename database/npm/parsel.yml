  title: Hardcoded Initialization Vector
  description: All versions of `parsel` have a default hardcoded initialization vector.
    In cases where the IV is not provided, the package defaults to a hardcoded IV
    which renders the cipher vulnerable to chosen plaintext attacks.

  title: Insecure Cryptography Algorithm
  description: All versions of `parsel` use an insecure cryptography algorithm. The
    package uses `aes-256-cbc` without integrity checks, which renders the ciphertext
    vulnerable to bit-flipping attacks.

  title: Insufficient Entropy
  description: All versions of `parsel` use an insecure key derivation function. The
    package runs keys of arbitrary lengths through one round of SHA256 hashing for
    key stretching. This allows for the use of keys of insufficient entropy with inappropriate
    key stretching.
