  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [network-manager][1] is a working with ethernet and wifi interfaces.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The `runCommand()` function within `common.js` file is called by
    `getDevices()` function in file `linux/manager.js`, which is required by
    the `index.process.env.NM_CLI` in the file \"linux/manager.js\". This is
    used to construct the argument of function `execSync()`, which can be
    controlled by a user without any sanitization.

    ### PoC by JHU System Security Lab   {#poc-by-jhu-system-security-lab}

        process.env.NM_CLI = 'echo vulnerable > create.txt & nmcli';
        var root = require("network-manager");
        root.getDevices();
