  title: Use After Free
  description: |
    [node-sass][1] is a Node.js bindings to libsass.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Use After Free. A
    use-after-free vulnerability exists in `handle_error()` in
    `sass_context.cpp` in LibSass 3.4.x and 3.5.x through 3.5.4 that could
    be leveraged to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
    possibly unspecified other impact. `node-sass` is affected by this
    vulnerability due to its usage of `libsass`.

  description: |
    [node-sass][1] is a Node.js bindings to libsass.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-Bounds. In
    LibSass 3.5.5, a heap-based buffer over-read exists in
    `Sass::Prelexer::parenthese_scope` in `prelexer.hpp`. `node-sass` is
    affected by this vulnerability due to its bundled usage of `libsass`.

    [node-sass][1] is a Node.js bindings to libsass.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-bounds Read.
    \]There is a heap-based buffer over-read in the
    `Sass::Prelexer::re_linebreak` function in `lexer.cpp` in LibSass 3.4.5.
    A crafted input will lead to a remote denial of service attack.

    [node-sass][1] is a Node.js bindings to libsass.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-bounds Read.
    An issue was discovered in LibSass through 3.5.4. An out-of-bounds read
    of a memory region was found in the function
    `Sass::Prelexer::skip_over_scopes` which could be leveraged by an
    attacker to disclose information or manipulated to read from unmapped
    memory causing a denial of service. `node-sass` is affected by this
    vulnerability due to its bundled usage of `libsass`.

    [node-sass][1] is a Node.js bindings to libsass.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Uncontrolled
    Recursion. There is a stack consumption vulnerability in the
    Parser::advanceToNextToken function in parser.cpp in LibSass 3.4.5. A
    crafted input may lead to remote denial of service. `node-sass` is
    affected by this vulnerability due to its bundled usage of `libsass`.

  title: Resource Exhaustion
  description: |
    [node-sass][1] is a Node.js bindings to libsass.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Resource Exhaustion.
    In LibSass prior to 3.5.5,
    `Sass::Eval::operator()(Sass::Binary_Expression*)` inside `eval.cpp`
    allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service resulting from stack
    consumption via a crafted sass file, because of certain incorrect
    parsing of \'%\' as a modulo operator in `parser.cpp`.
