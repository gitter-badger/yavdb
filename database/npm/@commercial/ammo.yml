  title: Denial of Service
  description: Versions of `@commercial/ammo` prior to 2.1.1 are vulnerable to Denial
    of Service. The Range HTTP header parser has a vulnerability which will cause
    the function to throw a system error if the header is set to an invalid value.
    Because hapi is not expecting the function to ever throw, the error is thrown
    all the way up the stack. If no unhandled exception handler is available, the
    application will exist, allowing an attacker to shut down services.
  affected_package: "@commercial/ammo"
  vulnerable_versions:
  - "<2.1.1"
  severity: high
  package_manager: npm
  cwe: CWE-400
