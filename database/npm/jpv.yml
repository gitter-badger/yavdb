  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |
    [jpv][1] is a Json Pattern Validator

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation. `compareCommon()` can be bypassed because certain internal
    attributes can be overwritten via a conflicting name, as demonstrated by
    `'constructor': {'name':'Array'}`.
