  title: Signature Validation Bypass
  description: |
    [github.com/square/go-jose][1] is a Package that aims to provide an
    implementation of the Javascript Object Signing and Encryption set of
    standards.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Signature Validation
    Bypass. The go-jose library supports messages with multiple signatures.
    However, when validating a signed message the API did not indicate which
    signature was valid, which could potentially lead to confusion. For
    example, users of the library might mistakenly read protected header
    values from an attached signature that was different from the one
    originally validated.

  title: Elliptic Curve Key Disclosure
  description: |
    [github.com/square/go-jose][1] is a Package that aims to provide an
    implementation of the Javascript Object Signing and Encryption set of
    standards.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Elliptic Curve Key
    Disclosure. It suffers from an invalid curve attack for the ECDH-ES
    algorithm. When deriving a shared key using ECDH-ES for an encrypted
    message, go-jose neglected to check that the received public key on a
    message is on the same curve as the static private key of the receiver,
    thus making it vulnerable to an invalid curve attack.
