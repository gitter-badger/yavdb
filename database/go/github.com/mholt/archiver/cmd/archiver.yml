  title: Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip)
  description: "[`github.com/mholt/archiver/cmd/archiver`][1] makes it trivially easy
    to\nmake and extract common archive formats such as .zip, and .tar.gz.\nSimply
    name the input and output file(s).\n\nAffected versions of the package are vulnerable
    to Arbitrary File Write\nvia Archive Extraction (AKA \\\"Zip Slip\\\").\n\nIt
    is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path\ntraversal
    filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive\nis concatenated
    to the target extraction directory, which results in the\nfinal path ending up
    outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip\nmay hold a file with a \\\"../../file.exe\\\"
    location and thus break out of\nthe target folder. If an executable or a configuration
    file is\noverwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn\ninto
    an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example
    of a zip archive with one benign file and\none malicious file. Extracting the
    malicous file will result in\ntraversing out of the target folder, ending up in
    `/root/.ssh/`\noverwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n    \n    +2018-04-15
