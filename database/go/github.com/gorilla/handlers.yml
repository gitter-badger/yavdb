  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [github.com/gorilla/handlers][1] is a collection of handlers (aka \"HTTP
    middleware\") for use with Go\'s net/http package (or any framework
    supporting http.Handler).

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. CORS is misconfigured to allow the server to reflect all origin
    headers. This may allow an attacker to make AJAX requests to vulnerable
    hosts through cross-site scripting or a malicious HTML Document,
    effectively bypassing the Same Origin Policy.
