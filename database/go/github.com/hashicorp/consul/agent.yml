    [github.com/hashicorp/consul/agent][1] is a distributed, highly
    available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure
    applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). Unbounded resource usage, triggered by the establishment of many
    unauthenticated HTTP or RPC connections, may generate excessive load
    and/or crash the server.
