  title: Improper Authorization
  description: |
    [github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pkg/server][1] is an open source,
    cloud-native SQL database.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authorization. A non-admin authenticated user can call any admin
    endpoint, even if they should be admin-only operations, as long as the
    endpoint is visible over HTTP. It makes it possible for non-admin users
    to shut down a node or view SQL objects on which they have no
    permission.
