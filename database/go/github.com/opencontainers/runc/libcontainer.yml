  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [github.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer][1] is a package for a
    modern container runtime.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. AppArmor restriction bypass is possible because
    `libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go` incorrectly checks mount targets, and
    thus a malicious Docker image can mount over a `/proc` directory.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    Affected version of [`github.com/opencontainers/libcontainer`][1] are
    vulnerable to Information Exposure. RunC allowed additional container
    processes via \'runc exec\' to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container.
    This allows the main processes of the container, if running as root, to
    gain access to file-descriptors of these new processes during the
    initialization and can lead to container escapes or modification of runC
    state before the process is fully placed inside the container.

  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    Affected version of [`github.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer`][1]
    are vulnerable to Access Restriction Bypass. Docker Engine 1.12.2
    enabled ambient capabilities with misconfigured capability policies.
    This allowed malicious images to bypass user permissions to access files
    within the container filesystem or mounted volumes.
