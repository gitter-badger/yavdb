  title: Open Redirect
  description: |
    [github.com/pusher/oauth2\_proxy][1] is a reverse proxy that provides
    authentication with Google, Github or other providers.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect. The
    pattern \'/\\domain.com\' is not disallowed when redirecting, allowing
    for open redirect. Authentication tokens could be silently harvested by
    an attacker.
