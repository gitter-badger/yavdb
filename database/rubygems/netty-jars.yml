  title: HTTP Request Smuggling
  description: |
    [netty-jars][1] is a gem for Netty JARs.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Request
    Smuggling. Netty mishandles whitespace before the colon in HTTP headers
    such as a `Transfer-Encoding : chunked` line. This can lead to HTTP
    request smuggling where an attacker can bypass security controls, gain
    unauthorized access to sensitive data, and directly compromise other
    application users.
