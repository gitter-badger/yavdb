  title: Insecure Encryption
  description: |
    [parsel][1] is a gem to encrypt and decrypt data with a given key.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Encryption.
    It contains a weak key derivation function, in which a key of arbitrary
    length is run through one round of SHA256 to gain key material of the
    correct length. This allows for the use of weak key material without
    appropriate key stretching.

  title: Insecure Encryption
  description: |
    [parsel][1] is a gem to encrypt and decrypt data with a given key.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Encryption.
    In cases where an initialisation vector is not supplied to the encrypt
    or decrypt call in `parsel.rb`, the initialisation vector used by the
    library is set to the hardcoded value in L10 of `config.rb`. This makes
    the cipher vulnerable to chosen plaintext attacks and data leakage
    within the first block.

  title: Bit-Flipping Attack
  description: |
    [parsel][1] is a gem to encrypt and decrypt data with a given key.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Bit-Flipping Attack
    via the `ciphertext` function. `AES-256-CBC`, the construct used in
    `parsel.rb`, has no integrity check (i.e., there is no MAC for
    integrity.)

    ### Details   {#details}

    A bit-flipping attack is an attack on a cryptographic cipher in which
    the attacker can change the ciphertext in such a way as to result in a
    predictable change of the plaintext, although the attacker is not able
    to learn the plaintext itself.
