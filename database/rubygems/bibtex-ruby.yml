  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [bibtex-ruby][1] is a BibTeX library, parser, and converter for Ruby.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection
    due to unsanitized user input being passed directly to the built-in
    dangerous Ruby `Kernel.open` method through `BibTeX.open`.
