  title: Man-in-the-Middle (Mitm)
  description: |
    [`puma`][1] is a simple HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM) attacks due to not explicitly enabling SSLv3. This vulnerability
    is also known as the POODLE attack.

  title: Denial of Sevice (DoS)
  description: |+
    [puma][1] is a simple, fast, threaded, and highly concurrent HTTP 1.1
    server for Ruby/Rack applications. Puma is intended for use in both
    development and production environments. It\'s great for highly
    concurrent Ruby implementations such as Rubinius and JRuby as well as as
    providing process worker support to support CRuby well.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Sevice
    (DoS). A malicious client could use `keepalive` requests to flood
    Puma\'s reactor. If more `keepalive` requests to Puma are sent than
    there are threads available, additional connections will be queued
    permanently.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
