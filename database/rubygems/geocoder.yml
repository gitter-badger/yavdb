  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    [geocoder][1] is a package that provides object geocoding (by street or
    IP address), reverse geocoding (coordinates to street address), distance
    queries for ActiveRecord and Mongoid, result caching, and more.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection.
    `sql.rb` in Geocoder allows a Boolean-based SQL injection when
    `within_bounding_box` is used in conjunction with untrusted `sw_lat`,
    `sw_lng`, `ne_lat`, or `ne_lng` data.
