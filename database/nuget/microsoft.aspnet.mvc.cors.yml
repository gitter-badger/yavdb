  title: CORS Bypass
  description: |
    [`Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.Cors`][1] is the core runtime components of
    ASP.NET MVC.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to CORS Bypass, which
    can lead to Information Exposure.

    ASP.NET Core 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 allow an attacker to bypass Cross-origin
    Resource Sharing (CORS) configurations and retrieve normally restricted
    content from a web application, aka \"ASP.NET Core Information
    Disclosure Vulnerability\".
