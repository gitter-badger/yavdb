  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [Gw2Sharp][1] is a .NET wrapper library for the official Guild Wars 2
    API.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. When using an instance of `MemoryCacheMethod` and using it
    with multiple instances of `Gw2WebApiClient`, there\'s a possibility
    that cached authenticated responses will leak to another request to the
    same endpoint, but with a different Guild Wars 2 access token. The
    latter request will not start however, and will return the first cached
    response immediately. This means that the second response (or later
    responses) may contain the same data as the first response, therefore
    leaking data from another authenticated endpoint.
