  title: Symlink attack due to predictable tmp folder names
  description: |
    [`npm`][1] is a package manager for JavaScript. Affected versions of the
    package are vulnerable to Symlink attack due to predictable tmp folder
    names, which were named `/tmp/npm-$PID`. An attacker waiting for a
    process named `npm-` to load could then go to the folder and arbitrarily
    change the files in the tmp folder.

  title: npm Token Leak
  description: |+
    This vulnerability could cause the unintentional leakage of bearer
    tokens. A design flaw in npm\'s registry allows an attacker to set up an
    HTTP server that could collect authentication information, and then use
    this authentication information to impersonate the users whose tokens
    they collected. The attacker could do anything the compromised users
    could do, including publishing new versions of packages.

    \nThe primary npm registry has, since late 2014, used HTTP bearer tokens
    to authenticate requests from the npm command-line interface. Due to a
    design flaw in the CLI, these bearer tokens were sent with every request
    made by logged-in users, regardless of the destination of the request.
    (The bearers only should have been included for requests made against a
    registry or registries used for the current install.)

    This flaw allows an attacker to set up an HTTP server that could collect
    authentication information. They could then use this information to
    impersonate the users whose tokens they collected. This impersonation
    would allow them to do anything the compromised users could do,
    including publishing new versions of packages.

    With the fixes npm have released, the CLI will only send bearer tokens
    with requests made against a registry. npm’s CLI team believe that the
    fix won’t break any existing registry setups. However, it’s possible the
    change will be breaking in some cases, due to the large number of
    registry software suites used.
