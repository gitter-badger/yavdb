  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |
    [PeterO.Cbor][1] is a C# implementation of Concise Binary Object
    Representation (CBOR).

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). The CBOR library supports optional tags that enable CBOR objects
    to contain references to objects within them and resolve these
    references automatically. A denial of service can happen if those
    references are deeply nested and used multiple times (so that the same
    reference to the same object occurs multiple times), and if the decoded
    CBOR object is sent to a serialization method such as `EncodeToBytes`,
    `ToString`, or `ToJSONString`, since the objects referred to are
    expanded in the process and take up orders of magnitude more memory than
    if the references were not resolved.
